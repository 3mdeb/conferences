The Future of Platform Security Measurement in Linux

The LVFS Host Security ID (HSI) has become the de facto standard for measuring
platform security in Linux, with major distributions adopting it to present
security posture to end users. Designed primarily around proprietary UEFI
implementations, HSI may present edge cases for open-source firmware vendors
working with diverse firmware stacks like coreboot and edk2.

This session examines platform security measurement approaches across operating
systems and explores opportunities to enhance Linux implementation. We'll
discuss potential kernel API extensions to simplify and unify the assessment of
the advanced security features, such as SRTM or DRTM.
