## Qubes Air: Opinionated Value Proposition for Security-Conscious Technical Professionals

### Abstract:

Building on the foundational "Qubes Air: Hardware, Firmware, and Architectural
Foundations" talk, this session outlines an opinionated vision of Qubes Air
vertical integration, explicitly addressing the needs of security-conscious
technical professionals like security researchers, developers, privacy
advocates, and SMEs operating in the surrounding ecosystem. Grounded in
Kicksecure/Whonix
[persona](https://github.com/3mdeb/verified-boot/blob/master/threat-model-persona.md)
and [threat
model](https://github.com/3mdeb/verified-boot/blob/master/threat-model.md), it
emphasizes potential vertical integration of secure thin clients and robust
servers equipped in Dasharo and Qubes OS. The talk will explore leveraging
recent qrexec-based RemoteVM advancements for secure delegation of sensitive
workloads, attestation, TrenchBoot for enhanced platform trustworthiness, and
preliminary PoCs demonstrating feasibility and value.

### Description:

Participants will gain insights into:
* How Qubes Air aligns with the threat models and workflows of
security-sensitive users.
* Leveraging qrexec's RemoteVM capabilities to securely delegate critical
workloads, including cryptographic operations, blockchain development, malware
analysis, and secure coding environments.
* Preliminary Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrations of RemoteVM functionality
as a key stepping stone towards broader adoption.
* Implementation strategies for attestation using the TrenchBoot ecosystem,
contributing to verifiable platform integrity.
* The business and security value proposition of vertically integrating
hardware, firmware, Qubes OS, and application software tailored for sensitive
technical workloads.
* The presentation serves as an investor-focused pitch, highlighting both the
practical path forward and the high-value security outcomes achievable through
targeted ecosystem integration.
