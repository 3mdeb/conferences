# Accomplishments - 2024-2025

* We successfully secured a larger and more diverse group of sponsors for this
  year's summit. Ticket sales also met our expectations. This increased funding
  is a significant factor in the project's sustainability and allows us to
  better plan future development.
* Thanks to this stronger financial position, we are able to fund lunch for all
  attendees on both days of the conference, fostering more opportunities for
  community interaction. More on the logistics for that will follow in the
  upcoming slides.
* Event organization improved:
  - A lot external talks in CfP, we had to reject some. Agenda is fully packed.
* Coming soon:
  - We keep pushing UEFI Secure Boot integration
  - TrenchBoot AEM - to some extent we can claim code complete, but we still miss
    upstream and production ready polishing, upstream needs time to digest
  - Certified Hardware with Intel Boot Guard and UEFI Capsule Update released.

# Feedback from Qubes OS Summit 2024

Last Year's Overall Rating: 7.75 / 10

Thank you for your valuable feedback! Your comments help us improve the event
every year. Here are some key points we focused on based on your input:

* **Audio Quality**: Based on your feedback about stationary microphones, we've made
  adjustments to the audio setup and look forward to hearing your thoughts on
  this year's solution.
* **Slide Readability**: We heard your comments on hard-to-read slides. We have paid
  closer attention to this during our preparations and are hopeful this improves
  the experience this year.
* **Venue Comfort**: We acknowledge the feedback on the hard wooden chairs. While
  they are a fixed element of this venue, it's a point we'll keep in mind for
  future events.
* **And on a sweeter note**: The "Krówki" are back by popular demand. You'll find
  them on the tables with cookies, with ingredient lists available.

We are always listening and look forward to your feedback for 2025!
