## Qubes Air: Hardware, Firmware, and Architectural Foundations

### Abstract:

Qubes OS has traditionally been recognized for its excellence on personal
laptops and desktops, securely compartmentalizing computing tasks. Extending
Qubes OS to modern AMD server platforms introduces exciting opportunities but
also unique security considerations. This foundational talk explores selected
AMD server hardware, Dasharo firmware (coreboot+UEFI), AMD's OpenSIL and Intel
FSP framework, and OpenBMC solutions. It outlines the architectural vision,
threat considerations for Qubes OS certification (including BMC, Platform
Firmware Resiliency), and a strategic roadmap toward securely deploying Qubes
OS on servers.

### Description:

Participants will explore:
* An introduction to modern AMD server platforms (Gigabyte MZ33-AR1, ASRock
SPC741D8-2L2T/BCM).
* Dasharo firmware integration leveraging AMD OpenSIL.
* Establishing OpenBMC (ZarhusBMC) as the secure Root of Trust.
* Security implications of AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP/ASP), BMC
security, and Platform Firmware Resiliency (PFR).
* A clear roadmap and milestone overview toward certifiable, secure,
server-grade Qubes OS implementations.
