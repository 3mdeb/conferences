# TrenchBoot - project status update

TrenchBoot is an open source project led by 3mdeb, Apertus Solutions, and
Oracle. It aims at the security and integrity of the boot process by leveraging
advanced silicon security features, like Intel Trusted Execution Technology
(TXT) and AMD Secure Startup. It integrates with open source projects like
GRUB2, Xen, and Linux, to perform a measured launch of the operating system
software, also called Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM).

The presentation will provide an overview of the project's current status,
emphasizing the key developments during the last year such as progress towards
upstreaming patches in Linux and GRUB, as well as bringing UEFI support for Xen
boot path.
