## Implementing UEFI Secure Boot in Xen and Qubes OS

### Challenges and Future Steps

<br>

## Piotr Kr√≥l
<!--
This talk addresses both the technical and procedural aspects and aims to
provide a comprehensive roadmap for achieving UEFI Secure Boot support in Qubes
OS, ultimately paving the way for a more secure and resilient operating system.

# What needs to be done

- Xen needs support for SBAT, which is not present yet.
- NX_COMPAT is required for SBAT support.
- kexec have to leverage SHA256 for checking integrity of executed images.
- kexec purgatory code should be built-in Xen.
- Livepatching have to check patches signatures.
- Command line have to be correctly handled (some options may be not safe).
- New hypercalls ABI for checking all passed pointers.
- Some debug options should have ability to be disabled at compilations time:
GDB stub.

<!--
Taken from previous presentation, check if it's done already.
Check if there is anything new in https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/8206
https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4371
