## Abstract

There are very few desktop platforms that are user-controllable through
open-source firmware. Moreover, they haven't necessarily been tested with Qubes
OS. However, recent initiative to port a modern Alder Lake desktop to coreboot
opened new door for privacy and security respecting machine capable of running
Qubes OS.

In this presentation a demo of Dasharo[1] distribution compatible with Alder
Lake-S desktop MSI PRO Z690-A WIFI DDR4 running Qubes OS will be shown. The
presenter will also describe new updates to Dasharo firmware and challenges
awaiting in future development. Also it will be discussed how Dasharo plans to
meet the future Qubes certification requirements[2] and approaches the openness
of the firmware based on Dasharo Openness Score of various supported platforms.
