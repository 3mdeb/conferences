## Session title

Challenges and status of enabling TrenchBoot in Xen hypervisor

## Description

The presentation will briefly describe the recent development and progress of
enabling TrenchBoot in Xen hypervisor, the challenges we had to overcome and
resulting changes to the Xen hypervisor project. The security properties of a
system running Xen with TrenchBoot support will be explained. A short demo of
running DRTM with Xen hypervisor will be shown. Also, the incoming UEFI support
and the impact on Xen UEFI boot process shall be discussed.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

TrenchBoot aims to unify DRTM solutions across all architectures and multiple
open-source projects. The goal of TrenchBoot support in Xen is a native
support for DRTM measured launch for both Intel and AMD silicon (and possibly
others in the future). Existing solutions are focused only on supporting
Intel, e.g. OpenXT's measured launch, Intel's Tboot. There are no equivalents
for AMD DRTM, aka Secure Startup.
