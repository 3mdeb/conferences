# Agenda

- Why?
- Hardware
- Reset vector and thereabouts
- Debugging tools
- PPC64 ABI, decisions and assumptions
- Implementation
- Current state & TODOs
- Q&A

???

This is the agenda, as you can see there is a lot I'd like to talk about so
let's begin.

# Why?

]

.right-column50[

### coreboot

- GPLv2, some BSD-3-clause
]

???

To understand why we even thought about this project, let's start with
comparison between Hostboot (which is part of, let's say, "traditional"
firmware for OpenPOWER) and coreboot. There are other parts of firmware,
running both before and after Hostboot/coreboot, but we considered them to be
good enough to be left with minimal or no changes.

We also made a port of Heads for this platform, but sorry, we don't have the
time to talk about everything.

As you can see, both projects are already open-source, so nothing really gained
there by switching to coreboot.

???

coreboot runs on many different architectures, Hostboot is PPC only.

#### Backup

Whether this is a good thing is
debatable, on one hand we can have common tools and drivers in the OS to
interact with coreboot (like cbmem), but OTOH peculiarities of one architecture
may negatively impact the rest.

to convert it into data that can be parsed in C/C++.

Code base.

- {{LOC counted with cloc}}
- roughly in the same ballpark
- empty lines not counted
- this doesn't include most of the new code for Talos. In total, we added about
35K lines, only a small part of that has been already upstreamed

???

The way Hostboot operates makes it full-blown operating system. It switches to
user mode to do most of the tasks as separate processes, while still switching
back to supervisor mode to do what can't be done in user space. Because of that,
it also uses virtual memory, while coreboot operates on physical memory only.

On top of that, Hostboot loads its libraries dynamically when needed. It is also
significantly bigger, so some of the code is trashed and has to be reloaded back
from flash multiple times. Please don't ask me how they deal with TOCTOU {time
of check, time of use} issues, it was so FUBAR that I didn't even bothered to
dig into that.

Because of all those differences, {{switch to next slide}} coreboot is much
faster.

# Why?

Hostboot may have open source, but that doesn't mean it can be easily understood
by humans. Initfiles are an example of this. This is how they look in source
form:

.center[.image-100[![](/img/initfile0.png)]]

.footnote[Source: https://git.raptorcs.com/git/talos-hostboot/tree/src/import/chips/p9/initfiles/p9a.int.scan.initfile?id=a2ddbf3150e2c02ccc904b25d6650c9932a8a841]

But this form isn't used, and AFAICT there is no public parser available.

???

Here's an example of initfile mentioned earlier. This particular file isn't
actually used by Talos II. File name suggests it is for Axone, while Talos has
Nimbus chips, more on that later.

There are only 2 .initfile files in this form in Hostboot source code, my guess
is that someone just forgot to remove them from the tree.

---

# Why?

Example of initfile in converted form:

.center[.image-75[![](/img/initfile1.png)]]

.footnote[Source: https://git.raptorcs.com/git/talos-hostboot/tree/src/import/chips/p9/procedures/hwp/initfiles/p9_npu_scom.C?id=a2ddbf3150e2c02ccc904b25d6650c9932a8a841]

???

And this is an example of converted initfile, part one - definitions. Note that
on this slide there are four different ways of writing 0 and three ways of
writing 1.

---

# Why?

Flow of every initfile is similar: read some unnamed register, check CPU
version and attributes, write magic number back, repeat for the next register.

.center[.image-100[![](/img/initfile2.png)]]

.footnote[Source: https://git.raptorcs.com/git/talos-hostboot/tree/src/import/chips/p9/procedures/hwp/initfiles/p9_npu_scom.C?id=a2ddbf3150e2c02ccc904b25d6650c9932a8a841]

???

Part two, the code. Always similar, read some register, check some attributes,
write magic number back, go to the next one.

Most of the registers are described in the documentation, but not all, I'll get
back to that later.

#### Backup

Other than license header, not a single line of comment in those files.

--

Can you spot the difference between statements of middle level `if`s?

???

There is no difference!

# Hardware

Talos II:

.center[.image-80[![](/img/talos2.png)]]

.footnote[Source: https://raptorcs.com/content/TL2MB1/intro.html]

???

Quick look at the mainboard.

Under a heatsink on the right, there is SATA controller - it's firmware is the
only part of the platform that isn't open. It is optional, version without it is
also available.

The platform has 2 CPU sockets, lots of RAM slots (registered DDR4 with ECC),
lots of PCIe.

---

# Hardware

Talos II Lite:

.center[.image-80[![](/img/talos2_lite.png)]]

.footnote[Source: https://raptorcs.com/content/TL1MB1/intro.html]

???

There is also Talos II Lite, cheaper (but still not cheap) and with less slots.
SATA controller is not an option on Lite.

```text
RaptorCS prices:
Talos 2: $4,126.75
Lite: $2,459.70
Mainboard only, add to that RAM and CPUs, ranging from $944.87 for 4-core to
$4,961.25 for 22-core.
```

---

# Hardware

Specifications:

- 2 POWER9-compatible CPU sockets
  + Talos II Lite: 1 socket
- EATX form factor
- 16 DDR4 ECC registered RAM slots
  + Talos II Lite: 8 slots
- 3 PCIe 4.0 x16 slots
  + Talos II Lite: 1 slots
- 2 PCIe 4.0 x8 slots
  + Talos II Lite: 1 slots
- 2 Broadcom Gigabit Ethernet ports, one shared with BMC
- 1 Microsemi SAS 3.0 controller (**optional**)
  + Talos II Lite: n/a
- 4 USB 3.0 ports, 1 USB 2.0 port
- 1 ASpeed BMC with OpenBMC
- 1 VGA video port

???

This are full specifications for reference, I've already mentioned most of them.
What I didn't mention is that the platform has Aspeed BMC, running OpenBMC. This
makes remote work very easy.

#### Backup

I can count on fingers of one hand how
many times I had to go to the lab to give the platform a push. The usual cause
was filling up BMC's ramfs to a point where it stopped responding and required
a power cycle.

---

# Hardware

POWER9 chip types:

- Scale Out (Nimbus) with directly attached memory, used on Talos II
- Scale Up (Cumulus, Axone) with memory connected through memory controllers
  called Centaurs

Nimbus modules (packages):

- Sforza - 50 mm √ó 50 mm, 4 DDR4, 48 PCIe lanes, 1 XBus 4B, used on
  Talos&nbsp;II
- Monza - 68.5 mm √ó 68.5 mm, 8 DDR4, 34 PCIe lanes, 1 XBus 4B, 48 OpenCAPI lanes
- LaGrange - 68.5 mm √ó 68.5 mm, 8 DDR4, 42 PCIe lanes, 2 XBus 4B, 16 OpenCAPI
  lanes

.footnote[Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER9#Chip_types]

???

When showing initfiles, I briefly mentioned Nimbus and Axone. Those are
types of POWER9 chips, respectively used for Scale Out and Scale Up.

#### Backup

Scale Out (aka horizontal scaling) means lots of small nodes running distributed
software, Scale Up (vertical) - one supercomputer, lots of CPUs and memory.

**Talos II uses the least server-like option.**

#### Backup

XBus connects two CPUs. There is only one XBus for Sforza, so max 2 CPUs on
board.

# Hardware

Many cores of SoC:

.center[.image-80[![](/img/power9_ppe_instances.png)]]

.footnote[Source: https://wiki.raptorcs.com/w/images/c/ce/POWER9_um_OpenPOWER_v21_10OCT2019_pub.pdf]

???

Now, lets take a look at all of the cores inside SoC. Main cores, visible to OS,
are represented as salmon blocks, everyone knows about those, they are boring,
lets focus on the rest.

Other cores are orange, most of them have dedicated static RAM, sometimes it is
shared between few tightly coupled components.

All of the orange cores are PPEs - Programmable PowerPC-lite Engines, they use
PowerPC Architecture v2.02 which is the same as implemented by POWER5
{https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Power_ISA}

OCC - On-Chip Microcontroller, responsible for "high-level" power management,
also uses POWER ISA, in slightly newer version: Power ISA v2.03

CME - Core Management Engine, responsible for low-level power management, e.g.
waking up the core after it was powered off.

4 GPEs in OCC complex - 2 of them have dedicated uses:

- SGPE - Stop GPE, used to bring back powered-down CMEs
- PGPE - Pstate GPE, used for frequency/voltage control of cores and package as
  a whole

#### Backup

Sforza (i.e. chip used by Talos) has less I/O PPEs than shown on the diagram,
those are used mostly for OpenCAPI which isn't supported on Sforza,

---

# Hardware

Yet another view of POWER9:

.center[.image-75[![](/img/power9_pervasive.png)]]

.footnote[Source: https://wiki.raptorcs.com/w/images/c/c7/POWER9_Registers_vol2_version1.2_pub.pdf]

???

This is POWER9 Processor from a Pervasive Point of View.

Simply put, Pervasive is kind of bus used to communicate with chiplets through
a mechanism called SCOM - Serial Communications. It was used in initfiles shown
on previous slides, it is also used by new coreboot code, a lot.

#### Backup

Each chiplet has its own prefix in SCOM address space. Sometimes a chiplet
consists of multiple subcomponents, e.g. memory controller has a set of
registers for each channel, and PCIe - for lane. Each such set lives at a
different offset, and documentation usually has description for only one of
them, but not necessarily the first one.

# Reset vector and thereabouts

.center[.image-80[![](/img/p9_ipl.png)]]

.footnote[Source: https://wiki.raptorcs.com/w/images/b/bd/IPL-Flow-POWER9.pdf]

???

Next subject: how the platform starts.

Sorry about the quality, it was already like this in the linked source.

Hostboot (and by extension coreboot) only does the steps in blue.

Each step has substeps, called 'istep' - IPL step, IPL =  Initial Program Load.
Those are described in the PDF, but no time to list them all here. As we're
talking about reset vector, let's focus on the left column.

Step 0 is marked as IBM confidential, but {{next slide}}

---

# Reset vector and thereabouts

.left-column30[.center.image-55[![](/img/p9_ipl_self_init.png)]]

.right-column70[
- Step 0: on OpenPOWER done by BMC.
- Pervasive: bus between internal SoC chiplets, also accessible to BMC.
- SBE (Self Boot Engine): PPE 42 embedded core used to do some basic
  initialization to each chip and to load and start the Hostboot firmware.
- SEEPROM: Secure EEPROM, 256 KiB, part of SoC.
- EQ: cache chiplet, `Q` stands for quad as it is common to 4 core chiplets.
  It contains one L3 and two sets of L2 cache. Sometimes L2 and surrounding
  logic is described as EX, but from Pervasive point of view it is part of EQ.
- EC: core chiplet, each core has 4 threads.
- SBE initializes one EQ and one EC, copies HBBL from SEEPROM to L3 cache, sets
  up registers and lets one thread on that EC to start executing.
]

???

... on OpenPOWER, it is done by BMC and partially FPGA for power sequencing.

SBE (Self-Boot Engine) is another of embedded cores in P9 SoC. It uses ISA 2.07
which is newer than that of other PPEs, it corresponds to an embedded subset of
POWER8. It starts execution from ROM mask - while the code for it is publicly
available, it is fused into the processor and can't be freely modified.

SEEPROM {{is Secure EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)
embedded in the SoC, it is not the main flash. It}} holds most of the SBE code,
as well as HBBL (Hostboot bootloader). ROM mask has enough code to load further
stages into SBE SRAM and start its execution.

SBE initializes just enough of SoC to let it start executing on its own. This
includes one EQ (quad, mostly L3 and L2 cache) and one EC (core). HBBL is loaded
from SEEPROM to L3, register values are set and execution on one of main cores
finally starts.

- PNOR is Processor NOR, to distinguish from other flash media (e.g. BMC).
- Partitions starting with `HB` are part of Hostboot, they take roughly half of
  64&nbsp;MiB flash.
- It has HBBL partition, but this is only an image that Hostboot uses to update
  SEEPROM.
- `PAYLOAD` is Skiboot, which implements OPAL (OpenPower Abstraction Layer):
  boot and runtime firmware services.
- `BOOTKERNEL` and `BOOTKERNFW` is Petitboot with optional GPU firmware, it
  starts target OS.
- Partitions with `E` flag use ECC for integrity checks.
]

???

This is how the flash layout looks like on Talos. For easier transition we
decided to reuse this layout, and put coreboot in partitions used previously by
Hostboot.

Hostboot takes about 30 MB in total, split across multiple partitions.

SBE loads and starts copy of HBBL from SEEPROM, which loads HBB and jumps to it.
HBB loads other code as needed.

Writing to SEEPROM is scary - we don't have any idea how many write cycles it
can take, and POWER9 CPUs aren't cheap. Because of that we decided to use HBB
for coreboot's bootblock and HBI for the rest.

#### Backup

Writing bootblock to SEEPROM was tested and it worked, but at some point
bootblock became too big, now it only fits after enabling LTO.

]

In case of HBBL, it is actually loaded at 0xF8203000, and first 12 KiB are
filled with placeholder for interrupt vectors. This leaves only 20 KiB for code,
and it must include SECUREROM (set of functions for calculating and verifying
SHA-512 hashes, part of Hostboot code, ~9 KiB after compilation) if Secure Boot
is to be used.

???

QEMU has `hb-mode` that is supposed to emulate how Hostboot is started, but
instruction pointer looks like a bug. HRMOR has value from IPL document, perhaps
this is how it was set for POWER8.

Next slide shows how those values were obtained.

# PPC64 ABI, decisions and assumptions

Boring ISA and ABI stuff:

- 64b CPU, supports both big and little endian
- RISC, 32b instructions (usually)
- 32 GPRs, some of them have defined use:
  + R1: stack pointer
  + R2: TOC base - combines GOT and SDA
  + R3-R10: passing parameters to functions
  + R3: return value register
  + R13: reserved for system thread ID
- other registers:
  + CR0-CR7: conditions registers (4b each, similar to FLAGS on x86)
  + LR: link register, holds return address
  + CTR: counter
  + XER: fixed-point exception register
  + FPSCR: floating-point status and control register

???

Important parts of this slide:
- endianness
- R1 - stack is purely software concept
- R2

TOC - table of contents

GOT - global offset table

SDA - small data area

---

# PPC64 ABI, decisions and assumptions

Endianness:

- POWER9 can use both big and little endian, and switching between them doesn't
require a reset.
- GCC built as part of `crossgcc` is able to use both, and it works for very
  simple C code as well as assembly.
- Anything complicated links with `libgcc.a`, a library of internal subroutines
  overcoming shortcomings of particular machines. It has e.g. epilogues for
  restoring many registers at once so they aren't repeated in each function.
- Separate `libgcc.a` for BE and LE, compiler defaults to BE one. At the time
  I&nbsp;didn't know that LE version existed and could be used, so BE was chosen.
- This exposed some endianness bugs and inaccuracies in:

???

Now let's talk about decisions. First of them is the use of big endian. This was
an effect of my ignorance and laziness, as I didn't know that LE libraries
existed in crossgcc built by coreboot, and when I finally learned about it, I
was already committed to fix "that final bug" in CBFS handling code

--
    + CBFS: `cbfstool` runs on LE host,
???

And then "that final bug" in FMAP

--
    + FMAP: not immediately caught because `0x00020200` is a palindrome,
???

And then "that final bug" in CBMEM

--
    + CBMEM: written in BE, read from LE OS,
???

<!-- Empty to keep the formatting -->

--
    + Mostly fixed by adding `htole`/`letoh` and clearly defining fields as LE.
???

<!-- Empty to keep the formatting -->

# PPC64 ABI, decisions and assumptions

Decisions and assumptions:

- SBE configures serial, coreboot doesn't have to.
- Make transition between Hostboot and coreboot easy for users by reusing PNOR
  partitions.
  + This results in having to use ECC. Other partitions read by coreboot use
    ECC so code for reading from them would exist anyway.
- Focus on use as a workstation, not as a server.
  + Some RAS functionality was skipped.
  + Fail on most errors, don't boot with parts of hardware disabled.
  + Don't use Processor Runtime Diagnostics error logging, not sure if it even
    applies to BMC-based platforms.
- Use Skiboot as payload.
  + Don't use the one from PNOR, add another to CBFS for simplicity. We have
    more than enough space available.
  + Use FDT for passing information to Skiboot.

???

Some decisions were made to make the porting easier.

There is a comment in SBE code that HB team asked them to configure serial,
because HB couldn't fit the code to do so. Remember that HB is ~30 MB and SBE
fits in 256 KB SEEPROM with ECC and HBBL.

FDT - flat device tree. Hostboot used HDAT.

# Implementation

- All.sup[*] required registers are documented in POWER9 registers
  specification
  + https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Category:Documentation
- Many hours (~2/3 of total time) spent on analysis.
  + Results at https://github.com/3mdeb/openpower-coreboot-docs/.
- Initfiles and other code rewritten into more readable pseudocode, with
  register names and fields decoded whenever possible.
- Some assumptions were made to simplify the code.

```
]

???

So how the implementation looked like?

1st register wasn't documented, its name was taken from Hostboot definitions,
but those definitions weren't used by initfiles. Some of them we found later,
because as mentioned earlier, documentation has only one instance of e.g. port,
which may not be the first one.

Numbers in square brackets are bit numbers. Because these registers are BE,
MSB is bit 0, contrary to x86. This alone invalidates use of bitfields.

About `ATTR_`, Hostboot keeps **everything** in attributes, kind of database.
As this is part of RAM initialization, those particular values came from SPD.
In other instances, it may come from a PNOR partition, VPD or be created from
XML during build.

---

# Implementation

Largest implemented features:

- internal buses and chiplets init
  + power on, initialize clocks, deassert reset, the usual
- RAM init
  + ECC requires all of RAM to be initialized (written) so ECC bytes match the
    data
  + Hostboot writes in order multiple patterns on each boot, we decided that it
    isn't necessary for workstation use
- PCIe init
  + just power on, train lanes and set up links, no resource allocation
- SMP init
  + OCC, CME
  + HOMER

???

RAM init: don't buy JEDEC spec if you don't need it, most of the spec is
available for free on DRAM vendors sites.

PCIe init: resource allocation done by Skiboot

OCC - On-Chip Microcontroller

CME - Core Management Engine

HOMER - Hardware Offload Microcode Engine Region

???

This diagram comes from a document that was added as a result of us asking on
OpenPOWER mailing list.

HOMER is 4 MB (per chip/CPU) block of data and code in main RAM. Without getting
into too much details, it is divided into 4 x 1MB sections, each responsible for
different part of PM.

1st: main OCC core code and data, OCC overviews work of all of the smaller
pieces, it also communicates with outside world (host and BMC).

2nd: SGPE code and data, responsible for managing and restoring state of Quad
(L3 cache).

3rd: CME code and data, basically does to core chiplets what SPGE did to quad
chiplets. It also includes self-restore code: few instructions that are run by
main cores/threads to restore GPRs, SPRs and some SCOM registers. Values to be
restored are written as part of the instructions. While it uses different way of
communicating with core that is being woken up, this is similar in principle to
how SBE started the first core.

4th: PGPE code and data, includes large tables mapping frequency and voltage
values to Pstates.

---

# Implementation

Currently, HOMER prepared by coreboot is different than what Hostboot does:

???

HOMER made by coreboot isn't the same as Hostboot's, but in many cases it is
closer to the math presented in Hostboot's comments.

--
- Hostboot uses complicated floating-point operations that in the end result in
  the same floor values as integer math would do

???

<!-- Empty to keep the formatting -->

--
- except sometimes intermediate values exceed `float` precision

???

<!-- Empty to keep the formatting -->

--
- Hostboot has an interesting approach to rounding:

    ```C
    uint32_t l_vdd = ...;

    // Round up
    l_vdd = (l_vdd << 1) + 1;
    l_vdd = l_vdd >> 1;
    ```

- enabling existing Hostboot's debug output to log math done when building HOMER

# Implementation

Non-technical issues:

- POWER9 documentation is relatively good, but not ideal
  + some missing descriptions here and there
  + changes between CPU revisions aren't always reflected in docs

- XIVE documentation was reported to be lost `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`
  + wasn't needed in the end

# Current state & TODOs

What works:

- booting Linux
- PCIe (tested with NVMe adapter and SSD)
- both CPUs, all RAM slots
- either Heads or Petitboot as bootloader

--

What needs more work:

- https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/labels/raptor-cs_talos-2
- more PCIe tests required (GPUs, ports under second CPU)
- Microsemi SATA controller not tested - our platform doesn't have it
- UART unreliable, seems to be cached - Hostboot doesn't have this problem
- currently only PNOR from Talos II System Firmware 2.00 is supported
  + newer release enabled Secure Boot by default (easy fix)
  + MEMD PNOR partition has different offset to data (needs analysis)

???

- I2C errors occasionally reported when accessing TPM
  + this TPM isn't supported under Hostboot, nothing to compare with

--
- upstream!

# Bonus slides

Function descriptors:

- TOC base must be loaded before calling external functions.
- Most instructions allow 16b offsets, so TOC base is typically the first
  address in the TOC plus 0x8000, thus allowing access to up to 64 KiB in single
  instruction.
- Function descriptor holds 3 doubleword pointers: entry point, TOC base (R2
  value) and environment (not used in C).
- Function pointers are actually pointers to function descriptor, not its entry
  point as on x86.
- All descriptors are collected in `.opd` (official procedure descriptors)
  section.
- This renders `build/cbfs/fallback/*.map` less useful for PPC64.
