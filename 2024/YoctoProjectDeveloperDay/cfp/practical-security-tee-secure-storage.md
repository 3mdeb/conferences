# Title

Practical Security for Embedded Systems: Implementing TEE and Secure Storage

# Abstract

In this presentation, we will explore practical security measures for embedded
systems using Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and secure storage. We will
cover the benefits of TEEs, the structure of a root of trust, and share insights
from our experience of integrating it within our Yocto-based Secure Embedded
Linux distribution, Zarhus OS. Attendees will gain practical knowledge and tools
to enhance the security of their embedded systems.

# Description

In this session, we will delve into the essential aspects of securing embedded
systems. The session begins with an introduction to the importance of security
in embedded systems, followed by an explanation of key concepts such as the root
of trust and the architecture of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

We will then discuss the practical implementation of TEEs and secure storage,
detailing how they function and the security benefits they provide.

Next, we will move to the current support within Yocto, discussing available
tools, resources, and ongoing developments that support secure implementations.
This discussion will be illustrated with our custom Yocto-based
Secure Embedded Linux distribution, Zarhus OS. We will explain its design, the
security features it incorporates, and how it enhances the security of embedded
systems. This segment will provide practical insights into the development and
deployment of a secure embedded
Linux distribution.

The session will include a case study of our involvement in the CROSSCON
project, an initiative aimed at standardizing the IoT security stack, and the
problems it tackles.

By the end of this session, participants will have a comprehensive understanding
of TEEs and secure storage, equipped with the knowledge and tools to implement
these security measures in their own embedded systems. They will also gain
insights from practical examples and ongoing projects to aid in their security
implementations.
