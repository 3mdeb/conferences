# Title

Open-source firmware validaation with Robot Framework

# Abstract

Explore the power of Robot Framework, an open source automation tool, in the
context of low-level firmware validation through Dasharo Open Source Firmware
Validation (OSFV). Gain insights from multi-year experiences in firmware
validation, backed by tens of firmware releases, and thousands of tests
executions, understanding the challenges of testing on real hardware: from
network appliances, through laptops and workstations. This presentation
provides an overview of the current state of the Dasharo OSFV project, outlines
future plans, and highlights the tangible benefits of adopting OSFV. Join us to
learn how you can kickstart your firmware validation journey using accessible
and effective methods.
