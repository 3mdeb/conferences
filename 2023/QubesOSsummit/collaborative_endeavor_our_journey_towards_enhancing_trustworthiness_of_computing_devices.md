  Certified Hardware

# Lesson learned

* We have to meet as often as possible with creative and maker goals in mind
  - we are challanged by deadlines and continues lack of time excuses
  - there is no lack of time just bad time management
* We have to challange ourselves by roadmaps otherwise we will always have
  excuses for adding more to the release
  - those are not my words, those are words of Richard Stallman: roadmaps and execution
* We have to talk more often with business stakeholders
  - consider what they saying and try to solve thier bigger painpoints
* We can't solve problems for free
  - without fuel we will not drive too far
