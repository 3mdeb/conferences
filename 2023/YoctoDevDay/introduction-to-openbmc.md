Title:
Unveiling OpenBMC: Exploring features and preparing the build environment

Description:
Join us as we explore the powerful features offered by OpenBMC, the open-source
revolution in Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). In this presentation, we
will dive into OpenBMC's main features and share our journey of enabling support
for the Supermicro X11SSH-F board's BMC within the OpenBMC community.

OpenBMC, a Linux distribution for management controllers, finds its application
in various devices, including servers, top-of-rack switches, and RAID
appliances. Powered by the Yocto build system, OpenBMC has gained significant
traction. In this session, we will discuss the key features of OpenBMC and
provide insights into the contents of the openbmc repository [1].

The focal point of the presentation will be unveiling the story behind our
efforts to enable support for the BMC located on the X11SSH-F platform. We will
guide you through setting up the development environment and delve into the
necessary modifications required to make the initial support, as presented in
the patch from 2017 [2], compatible with the current version.
