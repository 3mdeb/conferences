# DRTM as a modern Root of Trust in OSF

1. IIUC we repeat things in bootloader. Why we have to repeat firmware work in
   GRUB?
2. ACM and its closed source nature is a problem because now in case of OSF
   companies like 3mdeb could extend support to TPM2.0, but it is essentially
   impossible
3. STM status?
4. in 2019 Intel promised to change license for ACM, but it didn't happen
5. KGPE-D16 - of course we will try to fix things while reupstreaming it
