# LVFS Host Security ID (HSI) and Silicon-Based Core Security

## TrenchBoot Summit 2021

### Abstract

With the ever-increasing number of platform security features, determining
the level of secruity of a given machine is not an easy task. For various cost
saving or market segmentation reasons, different tiers of devices may have
different sets of security features implemented.

LVFS HSI aims to provide an easy to understand indicator of a machine's security
level that an average consumer can parse and make use of.

D-RTM - Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement - helps provide a trusted
computing platform without the complexity and inflexibility of an S-RTM solution
such as Intel Boot Guard or AMD HVB. In this talk, we will discuss the ideas
behind HSI and how we can incorporate D-RTM compliance tests into it.
